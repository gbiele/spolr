\usage{
spolrn(formula, data, scale.X = T, sd_prior_b = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula.}

\item{data}{data.frame.}

\item{scale.X}{logical value indicating if predictors are scaled}

\item{sd_prior_b}{standard deviation for the prior for regression weights}
}
\value{
An object of class `spolr` with the slots
`par` and `value` (taken from `stan::optimizing`),
`standata` (data for stan model fit),
`b` (regression weights),
`zeta` (cut points for ordinal regression model), and
`formula` (R formula for regression model).

Regularization is achieved by scaling predictors to mean zeros and
standard deviation of one and setting the standard deviation for the
prior of regression weights to two.
